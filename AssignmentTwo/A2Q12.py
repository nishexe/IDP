Q: What are independent events? Give two examples of the same.
A:  If the probability of occurrence of an event A is not affected
    by the occurrence of another event B, then A and B are said to be independent events.
    Eg: If we flip a fair coin twice, knowing whether the first
    flip is heads gives us no information about whether the second flip
    is heads. These events are independent.
