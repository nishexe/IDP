Q: What are random variables? Give two examples.
A: A random variable is a variable whose possible values
   have an associated probability distribution.
   Eg: A very simple random variable equals 1 if a coin flip
   turns up heads and 0 if the flip turns up tails.
   Eg: The coin flip variable has an expected value of
   1/2 (= 0 * 1/2 + 1 * 1/2) and the range(10) variable
   has an expected value of 4.5.
